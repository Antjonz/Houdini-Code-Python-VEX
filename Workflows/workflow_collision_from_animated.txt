CREATE COLLISION GEO FROM ANIMATED FILE
=========================================

Creates optimized collision geometry from heavy animated geometry.

NODE SETUP:
-----------
1. Merge (bring in your animated geometry)
2. Unpack
3. TimeShift
   - Enable "Delete Channels"
   - Set to frame you want to use as base
4. VDB from Polygons
5. Convert VDB to Polygons
6. Clip (optional - reduce geometry)
7. Remesh (create uniform low-res mesh)
8. Point Deform
   - Input 1: Remesh output
   - Input 2: TimeShift output
   - Input 3: Unpack output
9. OUT

WHAT THIS DOES:
---------------
- Takes one frame of animation (TimeShift)
- Simplifies it to low-res mesh (VDB > Convert > Remesh)
- Uses Point Deform to transfer original animation to simplified mesh
- Result: Low-poly collision geo that follows original animation

BENEFIT:
--------
Much faster simulation with lighter collision geometry while maintaining
the same animated motion.
