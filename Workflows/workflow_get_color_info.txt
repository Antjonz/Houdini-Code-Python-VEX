GET COLOR INFO FROM OTHER GEOMETRY
====================================

Two methods to transfer or extract color information:

METHOD 1: Attribute Transfer
-----------------------------
Use the Attribute Transfer node to copy color (Cd) attribute
from one geometry to another based on proximity.

Setup:
- Input 0: Geometry to receive color
- Input 1: Geometry with color information
- Enable "Point Attributes"
- Add "Cd" to the attributes list

METHOD 2: Attribute from Map
-----------------------------
Use Attribute from Map node to sample color from a texture/image.

Setup:
- Specify texture file path
- Set attribute name to "Cd"
- Configure UV attribute if needed
- Adjust sampling options

USE CASES:
----------
- Transfer painted colors from one mesh to another
- Sample texture colors onto points
- Create color variations from source geometry
